# Hi, I'm thricee! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm currently an aspiring Cybersecurity Expert and passionate in learning information — particularly in the field of Computer Science. I'm self-taught in the Lua programming language — learnt through reading the Lua 5.1 Reference Manual. In which, I had built and managed multiple games as well as systems on the Roblox platform; which have been played by thousands of players worldwide. At present, I'm interested in pursuing my studies in the field of Computer Science related courses.


## 🛠 Skills
• Proficient in the Luau programming language.

• Basic knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript as well as C++.


## 🗂️ Projects
I have built and managed numerous past passion projects — namely [ArcaneZone](https://github.com/thricee/ArcaneZone); a Roblox sword-fighting anticheat that has a different approach to networking.

Other than that, I also have a passion for penetration testing — developing and creating "exploits" for certain Roblox games to help their developers to add measures to prevent these types of attacks. For example, I had developed a [open-sourced cheat](https://github.com/thricee/Zombie-Uprising) for [Zombie Uprising](https://www.roblox.com/games/4972091010/Zombie-Uprising) with the intentions of spreading awareness of these attacks as well as let people worldwide learn from my code.
